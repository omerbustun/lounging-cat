## Configuration
Before starting the server, you need to set up your local database configuration:

* Copy `config/db_config.exs.sample` to `config/db_config.exs` and update it with your local database credentials.

## Starting
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
